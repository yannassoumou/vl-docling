Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines information retrieval with text generation. It enhances large language models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant external knowledge retrieved from a database or document collection.

How RAG Works:

1. Document Ingestion
   - Documents are split into chunks
   - Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding
   - Embeddings are stored in a vector database

2. Query Processing
   - User query is converted to an embedding
   - Similar documents are retrieved using vector search
   - Retrieved documents provide context

3. Generation
   - Retrieved context is passed to an LLM
   - LLM generates a response based on the context
   - Response is grounded in the provided information

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in facts
- Allows LLMs to access up-to-date information
- More cost-effective than fine-tuning
- Can cite sources for generated content
- Easy to update knowledge base

Key Components:
- Embedding Model: Converts text to vector representations
- Vector Store: Efficiently stores and retrieves embeddings
- Retrieval System: Finds relevant documents
- Language Model: Generates responses

RAG is widely used in:
- Question answering systems
- Chatbots with domain knowledge
- Document analysis tools
- Customer support automation
- Research assistants

The quality of RAG systems depends on good chunking strategies, effective retrieval, and proper prompt engineering to utilize the retrieved context.
