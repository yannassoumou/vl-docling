Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An artificial neural network consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

Basic Structure:
- Input Layer: Receives the input data
- Hidden Layers: Process the data through weighted connections
- Output Layer: Produces the final result

Deep Learning:
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers (deep neural networks). These deep architectures can learn hierarchical representations of data, with each layer learning increasingly abstract features.

Popular Deep Learning Architectures:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
   - Specialized for processing grid-like data (images)
   - Use convolutional layers to detect features
   - Applications: image classification, object detection

2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
   - Process sequential data
   - Have memory of previous inputs
   - Applications: language modeling, time series

3. Transformers
   - Use attention mechanisms
   - Process sequences in parallel
   - Applications: natural language processing, machine translation

Training:
Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation, where errors are propagated backward through the network to update weights using gradient descent optimization.

Deep learning has revolutionized AI and achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other domains.
