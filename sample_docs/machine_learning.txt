Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Learning from labeled data
   - Examples: classification, regression
   - Algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, neural networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Learning from unlabeled data
   - Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction
   - Algorithms: K-means, PCA, autoencoders

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learning through trial and error
   - Agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards
   - Used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems

Applications:
- Image and speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Autonomous vehicles

Machine learning models learn patterns from training data and can make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.
